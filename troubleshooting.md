# Common problems

## Wrong created, updated date or other model information

This means that original creator updated site and we need to fix that problem.

## "sfmlab credentials not set"

You **need** to enter your credentials as [environment variables](environment.md). It needs to access non-public content (adult-only and furry content).

## Parsed content differs with site

In most cases your account is not enabled to see adult-only and furry content.

## Slow parsing speed

Parsing speed depends on your internet connection, load of original sites. Usual time to parse:

* SFMLab - 20-30 minutes
* Smutbase - 3-5 minutes
* Open3DLab - 2-5 minutes

You can try to play with *THREADS* variable.
